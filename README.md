# Dimensionality_Reduction
This is the Code for "Dimensionality Reduction - The Math of Intelligence #5" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday July 20th at 12 PM PST

This weeks challenge is to implement PCA on a dataset of your choice using just numpy. Bonus points for using a Jupyter notebook.
If you'd like a suggestion of a dataset cluster, use [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/jPmV3j1dAv4) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence series. We're going to 
perform a popular dimensionality reduction technique on an iris flower dataset to be able to clearly visualize it.

## Dependencies

* numpy
* matplotlib

Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)

## Usage

Just run `jupyter notebook` when in the main directory and the code will pop up in your browser.

Install jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## Credits

The credits for this code go to [rasbt](https://github.com/rasbt).I've merely created it again and tested to get familier with myself.
